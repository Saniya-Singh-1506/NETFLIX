"""#### 1. **Arrays and Strings**

* Basic operations: traversal, insertion, deletion
* Common problems: find duplicates, reverse string, anagrams
* Two-pointer technique and sliding window approach

#### 2. **Linked Lists**

* Singly linked list: creation, traversal, insertion, deletion
* Simple problems like reverse linked list, detect cycle (Floyd’s algorithm)

#### 3. **Stacks and Queues**

* Use Python lists or collections.deque for implementation
* Problems: balanced parentheses, implement queue using stacks

#### 4. **Trees (Basic)**

* Binary tree structure and traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder)
* Binary Search Tree (BST) insertion and search

#### 5. **Hashing**

* Using Python dictionaries and sets
* Common problems: two-sum, subarray with given sum

#### 6. **Searching and Sorting**

* Linear and binary search
* Sorting algorithms: built-in `sorted()`, bubble sort, merge sort basics

#### 7. **Recursion**

* Basic understanding and common problems like factorial, Fibonacci
* Backtracking basics (permutations, subsets)

#### 8. **Dynamic Programming (Introductory)**

* Understand memoization and tabulation
* Simple problems: Fibonacci, climbing stairs, knapsack (0/1)

### Tips for Learning DSA in Python

* Implement each data structure yourself first (like linked list class).
* Solve many problems for each topic — start easy, then move to medium level.
* Always analyze time and space complexity.
* Write clean and readable Python code with meaningful variable names.
